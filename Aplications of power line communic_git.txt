* Aplications of power line communication
-> Home Networking
-> smart grid
-> street Lightning
-> Indrustial Automation
-> Transportation(Ev charging stations to communicate and billing between the charging station and the vehicle)

* MAP messages(Medium Access Protocol Messages)
-> MAP messages are fundamental to managing access to the communication medium, ensuring that devices can transmit data without causing collisions.
-> MAP messages convey critical information, such as time slots, transmission schedules, and channel reservations, enabling devices to coordinate their transmissions effectively.
-> Devices within a network contend for MAP slots, often using mechanisms like contention-based protocols like CSMA/CA to access the communication medium in an organized manner.
-> MAP messages can also include QoS parameters, allowing devices to prioritize certain types of traffic like voice and videos.

* TXOPs (Transmit Opportunity)
-> TXOP refers to a designated period during which a wireless device has the exclusive opportunity to transmit data without being interrupted. It enhances communication efficiency and reduces overhead.
-> TXOP is a concept within the IEEE 802.11 wireless standard, specifically in the context of the Enhanced Distributed Channel Access (EDCA) mechanism.
-> Different types of traffic, categorized by priorities (e.g., voice, video, best effort), contend for TXOPs based on their access category parameters, such as contention window size and backoff mechanism.
-> During contention, devices select a random backoff time before attempting to access a TXOP. This process helps reduce collisions and ensures fair access among contending devices.

* Network Admission
-> Network admission involves determining which devices are allowed to join a network based on predefined criteria, including security policies, device capabilities, and resource availability.
-> During network admission, devices undergo authentication to verify their identity and authorization to assess whether they meet the network's requirements.
-> Network admission helps manage available network resources by controlling the number of devices that can access the network simultaneously, thus maintaining optimal performance.
-> Network admission may also consider the quality of service requirements of incoming devices to ensure that the network can meet their communication needs.

* Domain Master 
-> The Domain Master acts as a central control point within a power line communication domain, overseeing network operations and managing communication among devices.
-> The Domain Master maintains synchronization among devices, ensuring that transmissions occur at specific times or within specific time slots to minimize interference and collisions.
-> It handles tasks such as device registration, address assignment, and overall network configuration.

* End points :
-> End Points are devices that connect to the power line communication network. They can be anything from computers and routers to smart appliances and sensors.
-> End Points initiate and respond to data transmissions within the network, adhering to the coordination and rules set by the Domain Master.
-> End Points receive incoming data, process it, and take appropriate actions based on the application or system requirements.
-> End Points may have different roles within the network, such as data sources, sinks, or relays, depending on the specific application.
